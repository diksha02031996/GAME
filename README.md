# GAME
It is a basic game implement by using C programming language.

We all played this game in our childhood on paper that is 3*3 block was there,
we have to make same line of symbol horizontally or vertically at any rows or columns.if same line of symbol
were create we considered as a winner.


Same things are used in my code with some differences istead of symbols i used numbers here.

For Example,
i provide 3*3 block in which user enter the numbers.
if entered block is
1   1   1
2   3   4
5   6   7

here we can see that first horizontal line having the same entered numbers that is 1, so here we have to consider as a winner and will 
get 10 points
if user enterd block like this,
1    2   3
4    5   6
7    8   9
In above-enterd block, we can see that there is no single line with the same number, so here we marked it as Looser and will loose -10
points but after that, I also offer one more chance to play and win the game
